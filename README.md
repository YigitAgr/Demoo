# Demoo
I try my best, but there are still some areas where I'm not quite confident in my code. I think I need some advice. All the other methods are completed and work fine, but as I mentioned, I sometimes make mistakes with the folder structure, and I occasionally write methods in different folders. I need guidance in these areas.
